# Project Summary

## Backend

The backend of this project is built using the Go programming language, using a RESTful API architecture to handle HTTP requests. Gofiber, a high-performance web framework for Go, is utilized to build the endpoints of the API. The data persistence layer is facilitated by PostgreSQL, an open-source relational database management system. The main functionalities include user signup, user login, message storage, and handling upvotes and downvotes. It also uses bcrypt for basic password encryption.

The backend is designed to handle HTTP requests for signup and login, rejecting login requests if the provided username and password do not match the stored records. Whenever it receives a message from a user, it stores it in the database. It's also capable of handling race conditions to enable a scalable upvote and downvote functionality.

Additionally, the backend is designed to handle race conditions robustly for a horizontally scalable upvote and downvote functionality. This aspect is critical for maintaining data integrity and accuracy when the application scales and multiple users interact with it concurrently.

The backend code is organized into various packages and files, with a primary focus on handlers, which contains the register-handler.go file. This file is responsible for defining HTTP handlers and processing signup and login requests.


There is also another README file inside the go-backend, which demonstrates the working and setup of backend.

## Frontend

The frontend of this project is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It also utilizes the Material-UI library for prebuilt React components that follow Material Design guidelines by Google. The main functionalities include user registration, user login, and message posting.

Upon user registration, the frontend sends a request to the backend, captures the user ID generated by the backend, and stores it in the local storage. During user login, the frontend sends the user credentials to the backend and handles the login based on the response from the backend.

The messages from users are displayed in a feed-like structure. Each message has upvote and downvote buttons, the functionality of which is maintained by the backend to ensure accuracy in a scalable environment.

The frontend code follows the standard React project structure with components, hooks, and context for state management.

There is also another README file inside the chat-vite, which demonstrates the working of frontend.

# Limitations

As per the optional requirements, which was doing the deployment on miniKube couldn't be done as the docker file for the frontend (chat-vite) couldn't be built for some unknown errors. We know that building the Docker images and containers for both Frontend and Backend are necessary for doing the deployment in Kurbernetes.
